# Create: Astral Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

If you are a contributor, please update this file with the changes you have made!

The format is a slight modification of the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) style, and this project's versioning follows a similar system to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), but not to the letter.

Release dates attached to version numbers are in the format `YYYY/MM/DD` as per the standards of [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html), recommended by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Please note that patch notes for versions 2.1.3 and lower are currently lacking in full information, or may even be entirely inaccurate, due to poor documentation of changes before implementation of the changelog. If you notice anything that is incorrect or missing, please open a Pull Request with your fixes.

## 2.1.4 [Unreleased]

**IMPORTANT:**

This update comes with a completely overhauled file structure for Astral's own code, making it much more consistent and readable, and adding type checking for the sake of ease of development. Almost every line of custom KubeJS and Datapack code has been verified, moved, or rewritten - this has potentially fixed countless bugs and missing recipes, and may have broken others. Please report any bugs you find in either our Discord server's Bug Reports channel, or on our GitHub Issue Tracker - and also please verify that the bug you are reporting isn't an intended change (please read the rest of the changelog).

### ADDITIONS

- Scorched Bricks now require Sap or Slime Balls, just like Seared Bricks, for parity with said counterpart.
- All three dough types have been harmonised into `create:dough` - meaning there are no longer recipes to make the other two types of dough, and all recipes now accept `create:dough`.
- Re-enabled the recipe for Rope from Campanion as it is the only rope that can be used to make rope bridges.

#### Quality of life

- The Chapter 4 "Observe Piglin" quest now clarifies that they are found in bastions.

- Added a tooltip to the Nether Engine from Immersive Aircraft to clarify that it is intended to not have a recipe.
- The recipe for Shimmery Compound now takes half the resources and time, and gives half the output - this is to prevent the mixer seizing up after completing each recipe and does not affect yield ratios.
- Gold Bars (not to be confused with Gold Ingots) can now be put into Hephaestus Cast Chests.
- The Hephaestus Encyclopedia entries now say exactly what each tool part does.
- Removed most of the remaining British English vocabulary from `/kubejs/assets/createastral/lang/en_us.json` and replaced it with the equivalent United States English spellings.
- Adjusted capitalisation in numerous quest descriptions and subtitles to be more consistent and to make capitalised words less overused.
- Added tooltips to Traveler's Backpacks that have abilities to clarify that abilities are disabled by default. Bear in mind that they can be re-enabled in the config file.
- Added a description to some of the quests in the Astral Signals questline to explain how to finish processing data drives as REI doesn't want to display the recipe.

- Grouped all Compressor blocks (e.g. Compressed Cobblestone) into one REI group.
- Made Rocket Casing and Desizer Casing able to be picked up with wrenches.

- Overhauled the in-game credits menu to include more people and generally look nicer and be more organised.

#### Bug patches

- Fixed missing text in the in-game changelog menu.
- Patched a Copper duplication bug involving Cut Copper blocks and waxing/melting them.
- Fixed weird face culling when placing a block on top of a Fermentation Barrel from Vinery, as well as made the front and back faces smaller to stop Z-fighting in this scenario.
- Appleskin is now present on both server and client, so now all saturation and food exhaustion information is available when playing on a dedicated server.
- The Astral Conduit now takes damage from being used on any portal frame block instead of just Shimmering Stone.
- Fixed Stone Growth Chamber quest descriptions saying that its output is based on the dimension that it's in, instead they now say that it changes based on what materials the structure is built from.
- Fixed the Get Silky quest description implying that kamas cannot collect slimy vines normally, when, in fact, they can.
- The Automate Blood Or Slime quest now only requires one criteria to be completed.
- The Biomatter quest in Chapter 4 no longer requires the player to automate Netherite.
- Modified the dependencies of the Distillation Tower area of Chapter 4 to be more sensible.
- Fixed the issue with the Moonset Marimo duplication recipe not giving a net gain of anything.
- Fixed a loot table not generating on Mars.
- Fixed the Leaping modifier on Hephaestus items not being obtainable due to recipe conflicts.
- Fixed the Reach modifier on Hephaestus items not being obtainable due to an item mislabelled as a tag in its recipe.
- Fixed the Tool Belt upgrade for Hephaestus armour not being obtainable due to an incorrect item tag in its recipe.
- Fixed the Killager modifier for Hephaestus weapons not being effective against Lunarians and Corrupted Lunarians.
- Fixed Desh, Ostrum, and Calorite tools not being able to be repaired with their ingots.
- The Distillation Tower and Shimmer Refinery multiblocks will now work properly with normal, liquid, and creative Blaze Burners (for real this time). Do note that due to a technical limitation, these multiblocks do not care what heat state a **creative** Blaze Burner is in, all recipes will work with any heat-state creative burner. This will not affect survival play.
- Fixed Hepatizon and Queen's Slime Recipes using different ratios of inputs at different heat levels.
- Fixed a recipe conflict between Milk Bread and Toast in the Vinery Wood Fired Oven.
- Amended Chapter 3's Automate Gold quest to provide accurate information about washing Soul Sand and Soil.
- Fixed a recipe conflict between the Ricochet and Replenish enchanted books.
- Fixed a recipe conflict between the Steel Screw Lock and the Steel Ring.
- Amended Chapter 3's Steel quests near the end of the chapter to stop spreading residual misinformation from 2.0 about Steel.
- Fixed a recipe conflict with the Lune-Shroom-boosted Shimmer recipe and the similar non-boosted recipe by removing the heat requirement for the Lune-Shroom-boosted recipe.
- Fixed a duplication bug involving the Yttr Chute by removing its recipe and hiding it from REI.
- Removed incorrect part of the description for the Tesla Coil quest in Chapter 3 to do with charging items.
- Fixed a description error in the Lead-lined Space Suit quest in Chapter 4 calling it a Netherite suit instead of a Lead-lined suit.
- Changed the recipe for the Yttr Lazor Emitter due to Brookite being unobtainable.
- Replaced Iriduim that was being used in some recipes with Yttrium. Also removed the Iridium Ingot and Iridium Block recipes.
- Made the Netherite Knife from Farmer's Delight fireproof.
- Added a missing recipe for sawing Rubber Logs to produce Bark as a byproduct.
- Added missing Copper Oxidation recipes to the Stonecutter.
- Fixed an issue where Shadow Drawers would keep eating Molten Tin when casting due to being able to be used in their own recipe.
- Fixed incorrectly assigned Spruce Log variant names from Chipped.

#### Minor mod updates

- Updated Create: Copycats+ to 2.2.2 as the mod has been known to cause rendering issues in the older version.
- Updated REI to 8.4.788 as the mod has been known to cause crashes in the older version.
- Updated Defined's Blocks to 1.0.2.
- Updated FancyMenu to 3.5.2 to get new formatting features.
- Updated Drippy Loading Screen to 3.0.12 for compatibility with the FancyMenu update.

#### Behind-the-scenes

- `server.packwizignore` now excludes FancyMenu configs as well as the new location for textures within the KubeJS folder.
- Clarified a few terms more explicitly in `LICENSE.md`.
- Cleaned up the main `README.md` file in the repository. Now it redirects to the other CAPITALISED markdown documents for further specific information.
- Wiped index.toml clean and added a clause in CONTRIBUTING.md asking contributors not to commit changes to index.toml. This has been done to cut down on headache-inducing merge conflicts that arise as a result of changes to this file. Packwiz automatically generates index.toml when it is run, so this should only affect the load time of the first time you run packwiz (which will be significantly longer than normal as packwiz generates index.toml).
- Added packwiz binaries to `.gitignore` to prevent them from reappearing in the GitHub repository in the future.
- Made Charcoal Blocks register their furnace burn time upon block registry instead of post-registry modification.

### REMOVALS

#### Mod removals

- Removed the Quarry Reborn mod as it is completely redundant and was non-functional anyway due to missing recipes for the last few updates.
- Removed the Global Packs mod as its function can be, and has been, fulfilled by KubeJS.

#### Game-changing

- Removed Released Coolant (fluid) as it wasn't used for anything.
- Made the original Stone Growth Chamber structure from 2.1 disfunctional - please use one of the new structures instead.
- Removed the recipe for the Turtle Shell modifier for Hephaestus armour as it has a broken attribute and hence does nothing.
- Removed the ability to obtain Yttr's curse enchantments (Annihilation and Shattering) due to an XP duplication issue.
- Removed the drill boring recipe for Skeleton Skulls, given they can be much more easily obtained by stonecutting a bone block.

#### Behind-the-scenes

- Removed the packwiz binaries from the repository to decrease the size of it.

- Fixed a recipe conflict in the Mechanical Crafter between crafting a single piece of Cobblestone into either Skipping Stones or Andesite Dust by making the Andesite Dust recipe manual-only.

#### Minor mod updates

- Updated StaREI to 1.0.1.
- Updated Defined's Blocks to 1.0.1

#### Behind-the-scenes

- Added `server.packwizignore` to `.packwizignore` so that it doesn't get included in client packs.

## 2.1.2 - 2024/10/31

> **Update from 2.1.4:**
>
> If you want to translate the modpack, please read CONTRIBUTING.md on the GitHub repository for a guide on how to do so. We'd greatly appreciate you putting the time and effort into making the modpack more accessible!

#### Mod additions

- Added a suite of REI addons:
  - Roughly enough Resources
  - Roughly Enough Loot Tables
  - Roughly Enough Professions
  - Roughly Enough Trades
- Added StarEI - an REI addon for Astral's Custom Machinery recipes.
- Added Defined's Blocks.

### CHANGES

#### Major mod updates

- Updated Create: Copycats+ to 2.1.4, which includes copycats for components such as cogwheels and fluid pipes.

#### Gameplay-changing

- Tweaked the generation in the Chapter 6 dimension to do with Monazite spawning.
- Added a new automation path for Blazing Blood using a Blaze Burner loop, removing reliance on having a player stand next to a Blaze Spawner inside a Foundry.
- Quantum tanks have been re-buffed to Tier 6 upgrade equivalent amounts (virtually infinite capacity).
- Adjusted recipes for Shimmered Apple and Seared Potato.
- Rebalanced some Astral Foods food statistics and effects.

#### Quality of life

- Tweaked the Stone Growth Chamber to use block tags in its structure to allow for more customisability.

#### Bug patches

- Patched out the existence of bottomless fluid deposits as they weren't intended to be in the pack. Newly generated worlds will reflect this. If enabling bottomless fluids in create config yourself, new fluids can be bottomless such as chocolate, blood, milk and honey to reflect them being useful in many automation recipes.

- Fixed the Distillation Tower not functioning with Liquid Blaze Burners (hindsight: this was in fact not fixed).

- Fixed a Gold duplication bug.
- Fixed Eggs without Chickens (???).

#### Minor mod updates

- Updated XPCrystals to 1.0.5, with fixes for XP Lake spawning.

#### Behind-the-scenes

### REMOVALS

#### Mod removals

> _Nothing to see here yet..._

#### Gameplay-changing

- Removed Venus and the "fake" Glacio (the one in Proxima Centauri, not the one in orbit of Mars, that one is still there) from the planet menu. Venus has been removed as it has very little content, is not at all required for progression, and is not within our scope to build upon any time soon.

## 2.1.1 - 2024/10/16

### ADDITIONS

> _Nothing to see here yet..._

### CHANGES

#### Major mod updates

> _Nothing to see here yet..._

#### Gameplay-changing

- Changed the location of the machine controller in the Stone Growth Chamber to be one block lower to allow for hopper/chute access. Old structure is retained so as to not immediately break existing factories, however it only generates Andesite regardless of where it's placed.

- Tweaked some Tech Reborn fluids to not use ingot amounts (111)

#### Quality of life

- Structure NBT (???)
- Fragile Sheet Blocks are now wrenchable to pick up.

- Fixed an issue where falling out of Earth Orbit would put you in the End.
- Fixed Space Stations voiding nearby terrain when created.
- Fixed the recipe for Seitan.
- Fixed missing names for Tech Reborn fluids.

- Fixed the recipe for the Shimmer Amplifier using impossible fluid amounts in the spouting step of the sequenced assembly.

#### Gameplay-changing

- Deprecated the original structure for the Stone Growth Chamber in favour of the new one. Expect the old structure to be removed in an upcoming patch.

## 2.1 - 2024/10/08

> **Note**:
>
> Along with the issues of a non-standard documentation, the changelog for 2.1 may differ in language style from the rest of the changelog due to being originally written much more informally, as well as due to just how large of an update 2.1 was to Create: Astral. Due to its size, I have decided to just copy and paste the original changelog while organising each comment into their respective categories and fixing basic grammatical mistakes that I immediately noticed.
>
> If you wish to take on the responsibility of cleaning this up, please make a Pull Request on the GitHub repository - it'd be much appreciated.

### ADDITIONS

#### Mod additions

- Added XPCrystals
- Added Traveler's Backpacks
- Added Yttr
- Added Create Big Cannons
- Added Create: Copycats+
- Added Create Additions
- Added Project Table
- Added Create: Ender Transmission
- Added Create: Estrogen
- Added Storage Drawers
- Added Discord Rich Presence
- Added TrashCans
- Added Buildings Gadgets and Trowels

#### Gameplay-changing

- Introduced a new Chapter 6 and an actual tangible End of the modpack.
- Added many new structures placed around the world to strengthen Create: Astralâs 'unique' atmosphere (especially thanks to structure contest submitters). Structures are now vastly more varied, and even inhabit orbit dimensions.
- Introduced an entirely new create-related enchantmant chain, for automation of enchantments (in the late game, this extends above maximum level caps for certain enchantments).
- Added methods of obtaining meats and mob drops without directly harming an animal at all.
- Multiple new multiblocks spread across all tiers of progression have been created. (REI support for some may be limited or non-existent, but recipes will be explained within the questbook!)
- Added a Create: Astral multiblock to lessen the reliance on normal cobblestone gens to ease the strain item entities sometimes have on the game.
- Portals for Mars & Mercury now exist, but are less simple to obtain than the Shimmer Portal, and will be obtained later in chapters where you have already explored that planet. (Reducing reliance on rockets for when the 'gimmick' of them has faded)
- Added Immersive Aircraft "Blueprints", which can be found in generated structure loot tables. These can be duplicated infinitely once the first of each is obtained.
- Added storage drawers to provide a smarter solution to storage than packages and CSUâs. These come with custom-implemented storage drawer upgrades for smoother progression.
- Added two more dimensions that are relevant in Ch4 (one being entirely new), and another dimension is introduced in Ch6.
- Added train support for custom Astral Portals.
- Added secret plushies :3
- Added new Potato cannon projectiles, some useful, some less than useful, someâ¦ explosiveâ¦

#### Quality of life

- Re-added trinket slots to allow as many trinkets as you can fitâ¦
- Added prompt to rEaD tHe QuEsTbOoK

#### Behind-the-scenes

### CHANGES

#### Major mod updates

- Updated Create to 0.5.1 - Rise and Shine
- Updated Astral Additions to 1.3.1
  - Including new mobs, items with unique gameplay mechanics, a varietiy of fixes, and more.

#### Gameplay-changing

- Gave some love the entire quest book to include clearer descriptions, new automation explanations, and an almost entirely remade mid-endgame.
- Reworked the resource generation in its totality (goodbye, deepslate gen). Cobblestone generators still kick off many production chains, and all lunar cobble varieties can be generated in the Stone Growth Chamber multiblock in different planet orbits. All metals can be obtained in much greater varieties AND quantities from alternative sources, and those sources (e.g. create orestones) can be automated more easily.
- Reworked and added a plethora of new Create-ified food recipes for all food mods. (Inc. Liquid Food processing PR).
- Reworked Villagers to work in Create: Astral by changing the trades to not break progression, and changed some trader varieties to be more thematic to a create-pack.
- Adjusted the power generation curve by adding new options and reworking/buffing the lesser used ones.
- Reworked Tinker tool balance. (Buffed sledgehammer back to it's true strength. Additionally, adjusted lesser used tools to be more relevant).
- Changed inventory management, by making shulker boxes and the newly added Travelers Backpack (Compatible with spacesuits!) be accessible more conveniently.
- Reworked AE2 Recipes to work with Create instead of the Vanilla AE2 methods, adjusted the questline for it.
- Adjusted Ad Astra planet generation (Mercury is now flatter, but retains patches of extreme spikes and mars terrain is now more rough). Ore should now generate more commonly / evenly to incentivise exploring on your first visit.
- Superheating through blaze cakes are back, liquid superheating still exists and is even smoother, accepting the actual fluids rather than buckets when using a straw.
- Easier access to Brass Create components early-on, including the regular suite of funnels/tunnels, alongside stockpile switches and content observers.
- Added log stripping support for all wood types.
- Reworked a large amount of stonecutting & mechanical saw recipes so they integrate with Create sawing smoothly.

#### Quality of life

- Reworked the primary UI, and re-made almost all of the existing textures for Create: Astral that weren't directly created by us to be in-house.
- Create-Style sheet textures replace all types of metal plates, and transitional textures for a number of create sequenced assemblies should further differentiate items in active assembly lines.
- Completely overhauled the main menu, with new custom icons for the buttons with short animations to make it feel more alive, as well as a collection of screenshots from the community creating a slideshow in the background.
- Introduced many extra tooltips for more informational content regarding less-clear item usages.
- Added too many splash texts, to hopefully make you smile, because we love you. <3
- Easy access home from the end by shift clicking any bedrock at y=0

#### Bug patches

- Fixed the default settings configuration setup (Will now keep your settings every time you update the pack).
- Fixed fluid player behaviour for custom fluids (collision/floating/lava burning).
- Fixed common duplication bugs through updating to Create 0.5.1
- Fixed loot table behaviour (Example: Loot tables were sometimes not generating properly, when a player visits another structure of the same type)

### REMOVALS

#### Mod removals

- Removed Create: Sifter - its recipes have been distributed between different standard Create processes.

#### Gameplay-changing

- Removed the reliance on 10k infinite pools of fluids, added tiered automation recipes for Shimmer and Lava, and further recipes for most other fluid types (10k pools are now disabled by default, but can be re-enabled in the Create settings widget on the pause menu).
