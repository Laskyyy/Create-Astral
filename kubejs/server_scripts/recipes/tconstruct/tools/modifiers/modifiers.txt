Hello this is mainly here for contributor reference.

When redoing astral's code this section was probably the most complex to transition to use kubejs instead of datapacks for all recipes.
As a result, the Hephaestus modifer recipes will remain in datapack due to their sheer complexity and also the fact that I've been working on this PR for the best part of 2 weeks now and decided it's best to just leave those where they are for now.

If you can think of a way to transfer the modifier recipes from datapack to JS then please be my guest, but for now they can be found at:
kubejs/data/tconstruct/recipes/tools/modifiers
