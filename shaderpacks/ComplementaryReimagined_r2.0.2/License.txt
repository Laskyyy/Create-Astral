       specific agreement file you are reading from is found in.

  0.2. "Normal Usage" means usage of The Pack as intended for the general
       public. This includes most usage, but the following usages are
       definitely NOT considered Normal Usage:
         a. Redistributing (parts of) The Pack
         b. Modifying code of The Pack

       game "Minecraft: Java Edition".

  0.5. "Modified Pack" means a software package that consists of The Pack but
       with the code intentionally being changed to differ from The Pack.

1. Grants
---------
  1.1. All Users are free to use This Pack for Normal Usage. This isn't
       limited to, but includes:
         a. Using The Pack for gameplay
         b. Using The Pack for content creation
  
  1.2. This Pack is allowed to be redistributed inside a Modpack as long as
       the following conditions are met:
         a. This Pack must be visibly credited in the Modpack's description
            page(s).
         b. The author of the Modpack must acknowledge that any problems that
            may arise from using This Pack in their Modpack is entirely under
            the responsibility of the author of the Modpack.

  1.3. This Pack is allowed to be redistributed as a Modified Pack as long as
       the following conditions are met:
         a. This Pack must be visibly credited in the description page(s) of
            the Modified Pack.
         b. This agreement file must still be left inside the Modified Pack
            without any changes being made to it.
         c. The Modified Pack must not have the word "Complementary" in it's
            name, and there should be at least 3 character difference between
            the name of the Modified Pack and This Pack. Adding or removing
            invisible characters or the removal of "Complementary" does not
            count as a character difference.
         d. The Modified Pack must look noticeably different from The Pack
            in multiple common gameplay scenarios that must include daytime
            overworld visuals, regardless of the setting or variable changes
            in the Modified Pack and/or The Pack.
