# Create-Astral

Dev GitHub repository for the Create: Astral modpack

Suggestions and Bugs should go in [Issues](https://github.com/Laskyyy/Create-Astral/issues), be as detailed as possible, so things can be easy to add or fix!

Does not include mods, or most configs, only pack specific files which are used when compiling the pack for CurseForge.

## Contributing

For developers: If you just want to edit the text, do it in this [file](resources/createastral/lang/en_us.json) (Ponders are in this [file](kubejs/assets/ponderjs_generated/lang/en_us.json)), editing the text in other files will NOT work! If you want to add items, blocks, fluids, tooltips and everything else that contains text, please use the translation key and the [lang file](resources/createastral/lang/en_us.json).

Here's an [example](https://github.com/Laskyyy/Create-Astral/pull/389) of changing the added tooltip and some other text to a translation key. For adding a new item/block/fluid, the naming of the key in the language file needs to follow these rules.

To name keys in the [lang file](resources/createastral/lang/en_us.json) correctly, you need use the **prefix** (`item/block/fluid`) + the **namespace** of mod (such as `kubejs`,`create_astral`) + the **id** of item/block/fluid. For vaules, it's the **displayed name** instead of translation keys. There is a example.

```json
{
    "item.createastral.crushed_raw_desh": "Crushed Raw Desh",
    "block.kubejs.fragile_sheet_block": "Fragile Sheet Block",
    "fluid.kubejs.molten_calorite": "Calorite",
}
```

For other texts in javascript, you should use [Text Components](https://wiki.latvian.dev/books/kubejs-legacy/page/components-kubejs-and-you). There is a [example](kubejs/startup_scripts/item_tooltip.js#L402C2-L407C7).

---

This repository uses [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz), which allows a lightweight repository such as this to be built into a full modpack by downloading mods from Modrinth or CurseForge.

The following instructions are a simplified version of the [packwiz installer tutorial](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/), so if you run into any issues, you should check there.
First, clone this repository to wherever you want and use your code editor of choice. We recommend you use Visual Studio Code or the open source version VSCodium.

To start, make sure you have [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) or a launcher similar to it such as [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/)

Create an instance in the launcher with just the Minecraft version (1.18.2), and fabric version (0.14.24). Increase memory allocation to about 6-8G for the instance if you haven't already set it as a global value in your Launcher.

Download the packwiz installer jar from [packwiz-installer-bootstrap](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases), and put it into the `.minecraft/` folder in the instance. If it isn't there already, you can just create a folder with that name or start the instance once.

Go to Edit Instance â‡’ Settings â‡’ Custom commands, then check the Custom Commands box and paste the following command into the pre-launch command field:

```shell
"$INST_JAVA" -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar http://localhost:8080/pack.toml
```

Now that all of that is ready, navigate to the repository in your terminal, and run `./packwiz.exe serve`

This will host a copy of pack.toml that is updated every time it is queried, meaning that every time you start the Minecraft instance, it will be able to get the most updated version of all your changes, and update the instance to match, meaning that all you need to do to reload all of your changes is to restart your Minecraft instance.

If you want, you could also write a batch script that runs the jar file similarly to how it is run at the startup of the instance, that you could run to reload the modpack without restarting the game.

## Automatic Builds

This repository is configured to automatically build the client and server pack via GitHub actions.
The [serverpack](serverpack) folder gets special treatment in this, as its contents get lifted to the
root directory during this build phase
