# Create-Astral

Dev GitHub repository for the Create: Astral modpack

Suggestions and Bugs should go in [Issues](https://github.com/Laskyyy/Create-Astral/issues), be as detailed as possible, so things can be easy to add or fix!

Does not include mods, or most configs, only pack specific files which are used when compiling the pack for CurseForge. This is done to make the repository as lightweight as possible.

The [serverpack](serverpack) folder gets special treatment in this, as its contents get lifted to the
root directory during this build phase
